# How to Configure ElasticEmail on Open Classifieds?

As we have posted in our **[blog ](/elastic-email-review/)** earlier, you could now have **[ElasticEmail ](https://elasticemail.com/account#/open-classifieds)** integrated into your e-mailing function in Open Classifieds. You would do that for multiple reasons. Some of them could be: your server can't send e-mails, e-mails not reaching users' inbox or you want to trace the e-mails you're sending.

### How it works:

Here are the simple steps you need to do to have it integrated into your website: 

1. Set up an **[ElasticEmail](http://j.mp/elasticemailoc)** account 
2. Go to your **account info** (as shown in the picture) 

![Elastic Email Dashboard](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Elastic-Email-Dashboard-1024x233.png)

3\. Scroll down to **SMTP/API Configuration** 

4\. Copy the information from there (you will need the **username, password, server** and **port** )

![Elastic Email info](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Elastic-Email-info-1024x473.png) 

5\. Go to **Open-classifieds Panel** , choose **Settings** and press **Email** 

6\. Change the values in **Smtp active**, **Smtp ssl**, and **Smtp auth** to **ON** 

7\. Input the information you got from ElasticEmail dashboard in the empty boxes accordingly (shown in the picture below) 

8\. Press **Save**

Now every e-mail you send using OC admin panel will be sent through your ElasticEmail account. 

For any questions please don't hesitate to contact us!
