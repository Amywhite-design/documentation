<p>On the list you see the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>category,</strong> <strong>location</strong> (where the ad was published), <strong>hits</strong>, <strong>status</strong>, <strong>published</strong>, <strong>created</strong>. What is more, you have the possibility of searching for the adequate ads by using a field: <strong>Search</strong>. On the right side you have buttons representing different available actions.
