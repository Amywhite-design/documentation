# How to Import Advertisements

It's much easier to import advertisements instead of inserting them one by one. This new feature is included in our [2.4.0 release](http://open-classifieds.com/2015/04/28/open-classifieds-2-4-0/) as well as many other features. 

You can use this easy import tool to add all of your ads with a press of a button. You simple need to follow those steps:

+ Log into your **Admin Panel** 
+ Go to **Tools** > **Import Tool**
+ Click **Browse** to select your CVS file and then press **Upload**

+ Click **Process** on the right box.

Now, you can see the imported ads on **Classifieds** -> **Advertisements**.
