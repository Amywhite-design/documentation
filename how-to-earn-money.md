### Pay to post

You can make your users pay to publish an advertisement.

Go to **Admin Panel** and choose **Settings > General**.

In the field **Moderation**, choose the way ads will be published. To earn money you can choose **Payment On** \- then whenever someone wants to post an ad on your page, he will be asked to pay. You can also choose **Payment with moderation** \- users will pay to publish an ad. You will still have the possibility to moderate the ad before it becomes visible on your site.

You can also choose **some categories** where your users will have to pay to posting ads, while **in others it will be for free**. To do that, go to **Panel > Classifieds > Categories**, choose the ones that will need payment and hit **Edit**. In the last field of the form, write the price for posting in this category and click **Submit**. You may also need to **delete the cache**.

### Move to top or feature the ad

Some users who published their advertisement on your site may be interested in getting more views and reaching more audience with their listing. To reach that goal, they can pay for moving their ad back to the top or to highlight it by making it featured.

To set this option, go to **Panel** and choose **Settings > Payment.**

To **activate/deactivate** the option of featuring the ad choose **ON/OFF** in the **Featured Ads** field. You can also create [Featured Plans](https://docs.yclas.com/how-to-create-featured-plan/), so users can choose between them.

To **activate/deactivate** the option for bringing an ad to the top, choose **ON/OFF** in the **Bring to top Ad** field. Then set the **price** that users will have to pay to refresh their listing.

Keep in mind that for the price of "Featured Ads" and "Bring to Top Ad features", you can use a different currency than your users ads price currency. You can pick the currency on Settings -> Payment, [Payment Currency](http://docs.yclas.com/setup-payment-gateways/).
