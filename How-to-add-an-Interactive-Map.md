# How to add an Interactive Map

I have also come to you with something we have been working on, and it's the interactive map guide! As you may know with our latest release we added a new feature where you can add an interactive map to your homepage, but we have been asked many times to prepare something to guide our users through the process and to make it easier to understand what you need to do to add the map to your homepage.

The video are prepared on Yclas interface but it will be the same as you have on your OC panel, so you won't notice any difference.
