As your website advertisements amount increase, it can be a challenge to manage them. This guide will explain how to manage, edit, delete, filter ads and many more!

To access the ads management page, go to **Panel**, choose **Classifieds** and **Advertisements** from the left sidebar. You will see the list of **all advertisements** that are published on your site. The newest are on the top. Only 10 ads are displayed, to go to older ones navigate between pages of the list. What is more, if you would like to **manage your ads** you can choose **Panel > Profile Options > My Advertisements**. There is a list of your all ads.

On the list you see the **name**, **category,** **location** (where ad was published), **hits**, **status**, **published**, **created**. What is more, you have a possibility of searching for the adequate ads by using a field: **Search**. On the right side you have buttons representing different available actions. Just click one that you need and confirm when system asks if you're sure. The following options are available:

+ **Update:** You can the ad details.
+ **Spam:** Mark the ad as spam if you think that it is! The publisher of the ad will automatically be added to the [blacklist](http://docs.yclas.com/activate-blacklist-works/) if it's enabled and he will not be available to post new ads.
+ **Sold:** If the product is not available anymore, you can mark the ad as sold. This action will make the ad inactive.
+ **Deactivate:** Deactivate the ad without deleting it. Use this option in case you don't need an ad to be published but you don't want to delete it permanently.
+ **Delete:** Simply delete an ad that you don't need anymore to be displayed on your website. This action cannot be undone!
+ **Featured:** Manually make an ad featured. This option appears only when [Featured Ads](http://docs.yclas.com/how-to-create-featured-plan/) is enabled and it redirects you to the checkout page.
+ **Go to Top:** Manually renew the ad. This action redirects you to the checkout page.
+ **Stats:** Display the stats of the ad.

At the top of the page you have some tabs that let you filter or sort the ads:
