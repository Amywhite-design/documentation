# How to create a Featured Plan

With our 2.4.0 release we added the option to create featured plans for ads.

<br>
This feature allows you to give users the option to select between different length of the featured of their ad and pay according to your plans.

<br>
If you don't know how to enable featured ads please follow [this guide](http://docs.yclas.com/setup-payment-gateways/)!

<br>

## How to create a Featured Plan:

1. Log in to your Admin Panel.
2. **Settings** -> **Payments**, **Add a plan**
3. Fill the fields and click **Save plan**

Now, when a user clicks to feature his/her ad, it will bring him/her to the checkout page to choose which plan he needs to buy.
