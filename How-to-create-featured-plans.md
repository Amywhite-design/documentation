Note that the Featured Plans are available only for the Premium Users. When you 're ready to have a Premium Theme, go to our [market](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/).

With our 2.4.0 release, we added the option to create featured plans for ads.

This feature allows you to give users the option to select between different length of the featured of their ad and pay according to your plans.

If you don't know how to enable featured ads, please follow [this guide](http://docs.yclas.com/setup-payment-gateways/)!

**Users** can mark their ads as featured by:
