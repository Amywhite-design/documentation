Using our classifieds software means you have a variety of tools you could use without much effort. Since our 2.6.0 version, we have improved the statistics panel, displaying data you can take advantage of.

## Site Stats

**Site Statistics** are available in your Admin Panel -> Panel -> Stats. You can see the number of ads, new users, visits in your site, contacts for ads, paid orders and the sales made in your website.

## Advertisement Stats

Yclas provides comprehensive statistics about your advertisements. If you publish an ad you can see the stats for that ad, such as the number of contacts and visits as well as the overall statistics about your ads. 

**Follow these steps to see the stats of each of your advertisements:**

1. **Log in**. 
2. Click to the _profile dropdown menu_ -> **My Advertisements**.
3. Click on the stats button next to each ad.
