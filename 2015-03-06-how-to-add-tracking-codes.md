# How to add tracking codes
<br>

**Why you should use Google Analytics** 

It's useful to use Google Analytics on your website for several reasons. 

First of all, GA is the best because it's free and it's giving you much more data (who and when visits your site, etc) than any other free analytics software. 

Secondly, GA makes it easy for anyone managing a site to track and analyze this data. Its custom reports allow you to see your data the way you need to see it, whenever you need it. 

Lastly, everybody trusts Google Analytics data. Currently it's in use of around 55% of the 10,000 most popular websites and 49.95% of the top 1,000,000 websites.
