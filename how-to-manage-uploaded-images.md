Since our 2.6.0 version it's possible to manage images that are uploaded from the editor. For example, if you upload an image while you create a page or edit an email template or publish a blog post or create a FAQ, the uploaded image will be saved in /images/cms/ folder. 

To manage those images you can simply go to your panel, Content -> CMS Images.
