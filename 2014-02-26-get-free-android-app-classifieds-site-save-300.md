# How to get a free Android APP for your Classifieds site - Save $300!

Hello, 

Not long ago we were offering an Android APP for the amount of $300. Few people have asked us why we stopped offering it.

Well, we stopped that, because there are ways of getting almost the same absolutely for free...and I don't want to sell something for $300 while you can get it for free of charge somewhere else. It's part of our [core values](http://open-classifieds.com/2014/01/26/open-classifieds-10-core-values/) ;)

We had already made an investment to developed the previously offered APP; hiring a freelancer and learning how to modify it...but there was no reason for us to keep offering it anymore.

I will explain to you, how to get your free Android APP for any live website (although this makes us lose money but what the heck...)

**Follow these simple steps**

1. You will need to **install Open Classifieds** in your hosting and make it live, if you don't have [hosting check here](http://open-classifieds.com/hosting/).
2. You also need a responsive theme or even better, our mobile theme, which will work perfectly on mobile phones. Check our [themes here](http://open-classifieds.com/market/).
3. Once your site is live with a responsive or mobile theme check it in your phone to make sure that it works good.
4. Go to [http://www.appsgeyser.com/create/url/](http://www.appsgeyser.com/create/url/).
5. Fill the form.
6. As web site URL use http://yourdomain.com/?theme=mobile (if you want to use the mobile theme).
7. Follow the indicated steps
8. Get your android theme!!

**Here you have a step by step video**

If you need it published in the Google Play Store you need a Developer account, pay $20 and add the item. 

We have an account, we can do it for you but we need to charge you for our time and because you get exposure at our channel. That will be just $40. Contact us if you have any doubt. 

I hope this short tutorial helps you push your business further!
