Hello! 

I am not a big fan of Facebook since I do not use it (I used to years ago), but I understand that many millions of people use it on a daily basis. 

We often get people contacting or asking in the forums how they can integrate Facebook in their classifieds site. 

Today I am going to show you 5 different easy integrations. 

<br>

## Login with Facebook

With this feature you will enable users to register/login into your site without creating a user or password. They will be able to login later with their account. Fast, simple and useful! 

This one is easy, you will need to have a [premium theme](http://selfhosted.yclas.com/) and enable [social login]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-login-using-social-auth-facebook-google-twitter). 



## Facebook comments

If you want people to be able to comment on your site using Facebook you can use [Disqus]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-activate-comments-with-disqus) (which allow other social login) or the native comment plugin for Facebook. 

It's simple to integrate because we have a guide [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/add-facebook-comments) 
for you.


## Post latest ads on your Facebook wall

Automatically post the latest ads of your site on your facebook wall. [This guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/auto-post-social-media/) explains how to create a Facebook App and configure the settings in your website panel to enable this feature.
  

## Embed your site inside Facebook

I'm not sure if it's a great idea but, for example, you could embed the publish new form into a tab on a facebook page. 

To be able to use it, you will need to be using [HTTPS]({{ site.baseurl }}/move-classifieds-site-http-https), read how to do it here. 

The best answer I found so far is the one provided by [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/pagetabs). You can use any of our premium themes; they will adapt to the width of FB. 


## Share/Like/Follow on Facebook

This is the easier one and the most used too. We have a [Share](//docs.yclas.com/share-widget/) and [Follow](//docs.yclas.com/overview-of-widgets/) widget for this just add it in the sidebar and ready! 

You can also integrate any of their other tools like the [share button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button), [like a button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/) or the one I use, the [Like Box](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-box-for-pages). All of these options can be used on a Text Widget where you can paste HTML. Â  

Hope this works! If I find any other useful integration, I will let you all know.
