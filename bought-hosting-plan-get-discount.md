We referred to this in many areas at our site, that if you **[purchase a web hosting](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html)** from our [referral link](https://yclas.com/hosting-pro), you are entitled to a PRO license no support.

So it is a very good deal! 

**Once you do the purchase, [contact us](https://yclas.com/contact/) with the following information:**

- The **e-mail** you are going to use for purchase 
- Your **domain** 
- Your **Inmotion hosting ID**, which you can find in your receipt (looks like this IMH -XXX - XXXXXX) 

You can send the above information through the following contact page: 

**<https://yclas.com/contact/>**

Once you send us the information, we will provide you with the discount and guide you through the process, until your website is up and running.
