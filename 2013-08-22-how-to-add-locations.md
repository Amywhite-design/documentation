After submitting you should see the information:

_"Success. Item created. Please to see the changes delete the cache"_.

Continue creating new locations if necessary, **delete cache** after finishing to see the changes. To delete cache go to: **Tools** > **Cache** on the left sidebar and press a button **Delete all**.

New locations now will be available to choose in **Publish New Advertisement** form and visible in **'Locations' widget**.

#### **How to manage locations**

Like before: go to **Panel**, choose **Classifieds** > **Locations** on the left sidebar. 

Managing them is very easy. If you want to move locations and change their order you just need to drag and drop selected one to the chosen place.

To change something, e.g. name or description of the location, you can click **Edit** button.

To **delete** press red button with trash bin. Note, that when you delete parent locations inside of it will be moved level up - to the parent of the deleted location.

#### **Locations widget**

Additional options to deal with locations are given by special widget.Â To activate it, go to **Panel** and choose **Apperance** > **Widgets** on the left sidebar. Choose **'Locations' widget** from the list and click **CREATE**. Name the widget's title and select if you want to display it in a sidebar or footer. You can also keep it **Inactive**. Thanks to this widget navigation between locations is easier. List of them will be displayed all the time at the side or in the bottom of the page.
