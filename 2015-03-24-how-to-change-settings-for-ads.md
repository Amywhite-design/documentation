# How to change settings for Ads
<br>
Open-Classifieds allows you to control the number of advertisement you want to display per page, in RSS and Map. You can also choose how to sort them in listing and which ads to display in your homepage!

To access these settings go to Panel, **Settings** -> **Advertisement**. In _Listing Option_ section you will find the following fields: 

+ **Advertisements per page:** This is to control how many advertisements are being displayed per page. Insert an integer value as a number limit.
+ **Advertisements in RSS:** How many ads are going to appear in the RSS of your site.
+ **Advertisements in Map:** How many ads are going to appear in the Map of your site.
+ **Sort by Listing:** Sort ads in alphabetical order (ascending or descending), sort by price (highest or lowest first), date posted (newest or oldest) and display featured first.
+ **Advertisements in home:** Find more information [here!]({{ site.baseurl }}/manage-ads-slider/)
