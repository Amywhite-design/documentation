# How to use shipping custom field

_Note: This feature is available on our 2.5.0 release._

With our 2.5.0 release it's possible to create a custom field called **shipping** in which users can specify the shipping cost about their product. 

If you don't know how, you can follow [this guide](http://docs.yclas.com/how-to-create-custom-fields/).

If you create that field, when a seller posts his advertisement he will be able set the price for shipping by filling this field. Then, on checkout page, shipping price will be displayed after the price of the item. Finally, the amount of the order will be the price of shipping plus the price of the item.

Remember, it's very important to name this field **"shipping"**!
