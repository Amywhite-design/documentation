# Software requirements for installing Open Classifieds

_This guide is only for [Open-Classifieds](http://open-classifieds.com/)!_

There have been few cases when users were unable to run the software. That happens mostly if they don't check the needed requirements with their web hosting supported technologies.

**The requirements to run Open Classifieds on your website are:** 

- A computer that has a working internet connection 
- An internet browser 
- A web hosting that supports:
  * Apache 2+
  * PHP 5.5+
  * Short Tags
  * GD support
  * mod_rewrite
  * mcrypt
  * Gettext
  * Curl
  * MySQL 5+

We definitely recommend using our **affiliate's web hosting**, because it is 100% compatible with Open Classifieds.

**[Get started now from 3.49/month](http://open-classifieds.com/hosting/)**
