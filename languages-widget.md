If you have an international classifieds website or your users speak different languages, you can let them choose in which language your website will be translated to them.

To do that, go to your Panel, Appearance -> Widgets and create the widget called **Languages**. You can select where this widget will appear, the title of the widget and the languages you want to display (leave the field empty to display all).

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/widget-languages.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![widget-languages]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/widget-languages.png)
</a>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/widget-languages1.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![widget-languages1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/widget-languages1.png)
</a>
