## Why to use it

Cookie consent alert is something that you have seen many times at the top or the bottom of a website. The reason that you should use it it's because, since 2011, every website that is based in the EU should display that alert to let users know if they are using cookies. 

## How to use it

In Yclas, you give you the option to enable the Cookie Consent alert. It will be displayed once for each visitor to let them know that your site uses cookies.

1. Go to **Settings** -> **General**
2. Find and enable **Cookie Consent**
3. Press **Save**
