# How to mark image as primary

_This feature is available on our 2.5.1 release._

With this feature, users have the option to change the primary image of their ad. If a user publishes an ad with five images, he can choose which image will be displayed as primary by editing the ad.

### How it works

Let's say you have published an ad with two images. This is how it's displayed on Listing page:

![primary-image](http://docs.yclas.com/images/primary-image.png)

If you want to change the primary image, you have to click to edit the ad and then click "Primary Image" under the image you want to mark as primary.

This is the result!

Please notice that you can change the primary image as many times as you want!
