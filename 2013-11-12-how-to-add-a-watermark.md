# How to add a watermark?

Sometimes you want your classifieds advertisements to be unique. An important part of those advertisements are the pictures that users upload to your classified ads website. This is a unique picture that your customer is uploading. **If you don't want others to clone those pictures and preserve their origin you can activate the watermark on pictures option**.
