Hey! 

With our latest release, we added the option to have a fully functional forum section within your classifieds website. Please note, it is very simple to add. 

**Here is how:** 

1. Log in to your **Admin Panel** 
2. Go to **Settings > General** 
3. In **Activates Forums** choose **ON** and press **Save** 
4. Go to **Content > Forums**

5\. Press on **New Forum**

6\. Fill in the required fields and press **Create** Once you do that you can manage forum tabs just the same way you manage categories and list them and now your users can post in the forums.
