<p><br />
It happens sometimes that a user purchases a hosting plan at some company then downloads Yclas and tries to run it on his website but he gets surprised with unexpected errors, most of the times that is due to an incompatible hosting with Yclas. To prevent that from happening and with Chema’s help we prepared a list of 16 hosting providers that we tested and they’re working with Yclas we also included a list of tested hosting providers that are not working with Yclas.</p>

<h2 id="tested-hosting-working-with-yclas">Tested Hosting Working With Yclas</h2>

<p>These hosting providers have been all tested by us and we saw the software working fine with them:</p>

<p>RECOMMENDED</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="https://yclas.com/hosting-pro">HostPapa</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://inmotion-hosting.evyy.net/c/1252522/260033/4222">Inmotion</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://partners.a2hosting.com/solutions.php?id=4636">A2hosting</a></strong></li>
  <li>siteground</li>
  <li>godaddy * only linux based hosting and newly purchased packages</li>
  <li>mediatemple</li>
  <li>bluehost</li>

<h2 id="tested-hosting-not-working-with-yclas">Tested hosting Not working with Yclas</h2>

<p>These web hosting providers have been tested and all proved to not work with Yclas at the date of posting this article (some may change in time)</p>

<ol>
  <li>iPage</li>
  <li>fatcow</li>
  <li>godaddy windows based hosting</li>
  <li>000webhost</li>
  <li>hostgator</li>
  <li>Any other windows hosting is not recommended</li>
</ol>

<p>My personal recommendation would be <strong>Hostpapa</strong> in the US or Europe , <strong>inmotion</strong> if you’re in the US and <strong>A2 hosting</strong> if you’re in Europe, Middle-east and North Africa they all have good with 24/7 tech support, all companies have pros and cons but for me I feel comfortable when dealing with those 3 companies.</p>

<p>If you didn’t find your web hosting on any of the two lists then make sure it’s compatible with Yclas by checking the <a href="//docs.yclas.com/yclas-hosting/">software requirements</a>.</p>

<p>What’s your recommended hosting? have you had any good or bad experiences with any hosting not listed here? leave an answer in the comment section below and let’s hear the story.</p>
