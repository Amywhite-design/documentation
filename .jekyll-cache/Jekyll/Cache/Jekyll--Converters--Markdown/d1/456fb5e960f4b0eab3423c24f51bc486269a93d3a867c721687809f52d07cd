So you went ahead with your classifieds idea and started your website, but then people started telling you some advices about sitemaps and submitting a sitemap to search engines. Well, here is how you do that.</p>

<p>So what‚Äôs a sitemap exactly? Well, basically a site map is a document that shows all pages on your website and how they‚Äôre linked together, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map">Wikipedia </a>the definition is:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúA site map (or sitemap) is a list of pages of a web site accessible to crawlers or users. It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for Web design, or a Web page that lists the pages on a Web site, typically organized in hierarchical fashion.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Yclas generates your sitemap automatically, so it‚Äôs very easy to submit it to google, bing or any other search engine webmaster tools and here is how to find your sitemap:</p>
