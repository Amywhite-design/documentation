# How to add a watermark?

_This guide is only for [Open-Classifieds](http://open-classifieds.com/)!_

Sometimes you want your classifieds advertisements to be unique. An important part of those advertisements are the pictures that users upload to your classified ads website. This is a unique picture that your customer is uploading. **If you don't want others to clone those pictures and preserve their origin you can activate the watermark on pictures option**.

Before doing this simple activation, please be aware you need to have the **GD library** installed in your hosting. **To activate watermark** in pictures: 

1. Go to your **Admin Panel**
2. In the sidebar go to **Settings** > **Images**
3. Scroll down and search for **Watermark**
4. Activate it by selecting **ON**
5. Add the **Watermark Path** of your image example forÂ http://demo2.open-classifieds.com/images/wm.png **should be images/wm.png**
6. You can select where you want the watermark to be placed, at the top, center or in the bottom of the picture
7. Press **Save**
8. **Only new ads** would have the watermark ;)
