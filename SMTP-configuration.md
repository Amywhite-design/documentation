If you prefer to have your mail sent out via a different SMTP server than your hosting, you can use this option. What you have to do is to go to your panel, **Settings** -> **Email Settings** -> **SMTP Configuration** and specify or enable:

+ **Smtp active**: Enable this to activate SMTP
+ **Smtp Secure**: Enable if the SMTP connection needs to occur over ssl
+ **Smtp host**
+ **Smtp port**
+ **Smtp auth**: If SMTPAuth should be used
+ **Smtp user**
+ **Smtp password**

When you finish with the configuration, click **SAVE**

Note that there is no need to activate and configure SMTP if your server can send emails or you are using Yclas!
