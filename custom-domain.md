With this option you will be able to use  your own domain name such as **mydomain.com** instead of **mydomain.yclas.com**.

After creating your site you can go to your **Site Details**, and from there you can click on a button called **Custom domain**. Follow the instructions detailed there.


### About WWW.


WWW. its a subdomain, your domain is http://yourdomain.com/ if someone mistakenly decides to type the 3 extra WWW , he will be redirected to the real domain http://yourdomain.com/ so you wont lose any visit. This is much better and easier, the WWW do not mean anything ;)
