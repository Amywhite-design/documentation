To make your categories recognisable it is possible to add an icon to every category you have on your site. This option is available only in the **[premium themes](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/)**. Uploaded logo appears in the **home page** next to the category description as shown below.

**How to do it**


Adding icons to your categories is super easy! At first you have to create a category. If you are not sure how to do it, [check out our useful tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-add-categories). 

1. If you've already created the categories, you need to go to **Admin Panel > Categories**. There you can find a list of the categories you created.
2. Click the button: **Edit** for the category you wish to update
3. Find the field: **Upload Category Icon** 
4. Upload your icon (note! get your icon file ready in your preferred format with the recommended dimensions of 250px by 40px) 
5. Press **Submit** 

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/category-icon.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![cat icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/category-icon.png)
</a>

By doing this, you will have the image inserted next to the category, at the slider small box and the full sized image after clicking on the category. 

If you decide to change or delete your image, the steps are very easy as well. The red button : **Delete icon** will apprear under the uploaded icon. Just press a button, accept the operation and impose the changes.
