**[Chema](#864 "2013-05-22 00:09:49"):** Hello, That really depends on the company...some share hosting works amazing. I really recommend to you https://secure1.inmotionhosting.com/cgi-bin/gby/clickthru.cgi?id=chema&page;=7 Easily 2000 views per day. Clashosts works for testing that is all is really limited on everything and doesn't work in production.

**[Joe](#867 "2013-05-24 02:36:38"):** Thanks. If I experience reliability issues with my own shared hosting with an ISP in the UK, can it be moved easily enough to the Inmotion solution you recommend? Perhaps I should have just done this from the start!

**[Chema](#868 "2013-05-24 08:46:32"):** yep you can just move the DB specially if still small it's pretty simple. If you buy it we can help you on the support on a step by step migration. ;)-->
