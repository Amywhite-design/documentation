# How to Create a Blog?

Since versions **2.1.x** we included the possibility to **have your own blog** in your classifieds site. 

This is a useful tool to communicate news to your users, post updates, notify of modifications and to give them the option to answer you from the comments. Also there's an RSS for the blog. It's a simple blog system but you will enjoy the easy and straightforward way of publishing.

**How to activate blog posting:**

1. Login to your **Classifieds Panel**
2. Go to **Settings** > **General > Enable Additional Features**
3. **Activates blog Posting = ON**, will add the Blog icon to the header of your theme and also in the sidebar of the panel if you are admin
4. **Disqus for Blog** = will add Disqus system in the bottom of each blog post
5. Click **Save**
