# How to manage orders?

Open Classifieds gives you the option to _view_ and _edit_ the orders made in your website. 

When orders placed by users, they will appear on **Panel**, **Classifieds** -> **Orders**. _Note that only the administrator of the website has access to that area!_

Here you can view the orders made in your website as well as their details:
_Status_, _Product_, _Amount_, _User_ (who placed this order, username - email), _Ad_, _Date_ (date created), _Date Paid_.

You can also edit these details by clicking the button under _Actions_ on the right of the order.
