# How to change website icon (favicon)

A **favicon**, as explained by [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon), is:

_is a file containing one or more small icons, most commonly 16Ã—16 pixels,_

_associated with a particular Web site or Web page._

Since our last update to **2.1.4** we added the possibility to put a favicon file at your FTP in **Public/OpenClassifieds/images**. This way you won't have to add your favicon in every theme folder (as it was earlier) and you could enjoy switching between multiple themes on your website with the same favicon.

**Follow the next steps to add a favicon:** 

1. Log in at your **FTP** 
2. Go to **OpenClassifieds/images** 
3. Drag your favicon file and drop it there 

After this is done, you could see the favicon displayed next to your website name/address on browser tab and it wouldn't change when changing your theme.
