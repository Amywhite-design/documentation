## All ads expire after n days

This feature allows setting an expiration date to all published ads.

You can access this option by logging into your admin panel and going to Settings -> Advertisement -> Publish Options -> Ad expiration date.

And enter after how many days an ad should expire. If you enter 0 (zero) then the ads will never expire.
