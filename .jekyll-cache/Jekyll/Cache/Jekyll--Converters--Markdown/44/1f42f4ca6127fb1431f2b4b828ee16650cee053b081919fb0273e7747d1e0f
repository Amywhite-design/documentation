<h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com">Investopedia</a>, <em>Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù system designed to allow online users to process transactions through digital units of exchange called Bitcoins. Started in 2009 by a mysterious programmer, Bitcoin has generated plenty of interest and controversy as a ‚Äúthird‚Äù type of currency and an alternative to government flat currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro or pure commodity currencies like gold or silver coins.</em></p>

<p>It is the first and most popular cryptocurrency. Although there are a lot of other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin receives the most media coverage and it spreads like wildfire on social media.</p>

<p>First of all, bitcoin payments have low to no fees, can be transferred from one side of the globe to the other without limits or delays.</p>

<p>Bitcoin offers protection from payment frauds. Credit card and wire transfers require identity verification, which is a risk of compromising customer data. Bitcoin payments do not require the verification of customer identities and it doesn‚Äôt involve being responsible for customer information.</p>

<p>Chargebacks, where consumers go through their bank or credit card provider to force a refund, can be very costly to businesses. A 1 percent chargeback rate is the standard maximum, if your chargeback to transaction ratio is really high, credit card companies will take serious actions against you because you‚Äôre distinguished as a risky merchant. However, with Bitcoin, once the transaction has been sent and confirmed by the network, the BTC sent is owned and in fully control of the receiver.</p>

<p>Big companies such as Microsoft, PayPal, Expedia, Reddit, Steam and <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-28/who-accepts-bitcoins-payment-list-companies-stores-shops">many others</a> accept Bitcoin as a payment. Also, accepting bitcoin payments through your classifieds website will attract a market of new customers who are looking for places to spend their bitcoins.</p>
