Add a mobile responsive image in your website just by using its URL into the Image Widget. This feature gives you another option to customize your website design by adding images related to your site or monetize	your website by adding images as commercial banners.


## Upload the image

The image you want to use needs to be uploaded on the internet so you can use the URL in the Widget. If you don't have a place to upload the image, follow the steps below to **upload the image** to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) for free and **get its URL**.

1. Go to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) and press Sign Up.
2. Register with Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Yahoo or Email.
3. Once your account is created, press **New Post** -> **Upload Images** and upload your image.


Now you need to copy the URL of the image. After you uploaded the image, you will see something like this: [https://imgur.com/a/vGRo5](https://imgur.com/a/vGRo5). 

1. Right-click on the image
2. Press "Open Image in new Tab" (depends on the web browser you use)
3. Copy the URL of the new page/tab, which will be something like this: [https://i.imgur.com/22QwBSs.png](https://i.imgur.com/22QwBSs.png)
