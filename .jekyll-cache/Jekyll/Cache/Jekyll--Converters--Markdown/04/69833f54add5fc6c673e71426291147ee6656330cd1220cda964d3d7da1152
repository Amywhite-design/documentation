I"Ý<p>A new option for your website users is now available and it enables them to mark and save their favorite ads, this gives a better experience value to your website and I personally find it very useful when browsing a classifieds website.</p>

<p>To <strong>add an advertisement to your favorites</strong>, open an ad and press the heart shaped button as shown below.</p>

<p>Note that the highlight color should be red. If you press the button the next time and the icon change the color to white, the ad will not be included in your list of favorites.</p>

<p><a href="//docs.yclas.com/images/favorites.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery="">
<img src="//docs.yclas.com/images/favorites.png" alt="favorites" />
</a></p>

<p><br />
After this step, all of the chosen advertisements can be found by clicking the dropdown menu next to the profile icon and then choose <strong>My Favorites</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="//docs.yclas.com/images/favorites1.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery="">
<img src="//docs.yclas.com/images/favorites1.png" alt="favorites" />
</a></p>

<p><br />
At any time you can also delete easily an ad from the list of favorites. To remove it just press the red button with the selected ad.</p>
