# How to Add a Logo to Your Classifieds Website

Adding a logo to a classifieds website is a simple process that normally takes less than 5 minutes, you just need to follow those steps:

* Log into your FTP, or open your **file manager** from hosting Cpanel
* Get your logo file ready in your preferred format with the recommended dimensions of 250px by 40 px
* Upload your logo design wherever you prefer, for example let's say you upload it in the images folder so the URL would be http://YOURDOMAIN.com/images/logo.png
* Now log in to your OC admin panel
* Go to **Appearance** > **Theme options**
* Paste the URL into the "URL to your logo" field ( **[Premium themes only](http://open-classifieds.com/market/)** )
* Click " **Update** " and your logo should show up.

Of course if your logo doesn't show up right away try deleting cache and browsing in private/incognito mode because your website might be cached on your browser.
