Since our 2.6.0 release it's possible to report an ad as inappropriate.

Below each ad, users will find this button:

By clicking this button they will be redirected to the contact page, where Subject and Message are already filled with the necessary text.

Email will be sent to the administrator of the website in order to review the reported ad.
