## Homepage Map

Display a Map at the top or bottom of the homepage.

+ **Homepage Map:** Choose _Top_ or _Bottom_ to enable the map in the top or bottom of your website. Disable the map by choosing _None_.

+ **Homepage Map height:** Enter the height of the map. The default value is 400px. The height doesn't apply to the mobile view, it's automatically resized.

+ **Homepage Map full screen option:** Enable this option to show the Fullscreen button on the map.

## Map

A map comes by default after Yclas installation, but remember that you need to have some ads published with addresses recognisable by Google maps.

To access the map, click on the earth shaped icon at the top navigation bar.

<a href="//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/map-in-top-navbar-1024x150.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![Map in top navbar](//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/map-in-top-navbar-1024x150.png)
</a>

Once you do that, you will see all of your ads with real addresses showing as clickable locations on the map. Once a user clicks on a location, they can click on the address link to go to the ad itself.
