# How to edit your profile
<br>
This feature allows you to change your displayed name, your email, add a description about yourself, add your account to the website's subscribers and change your password. You can also upload a profile picture!

**How to edit your profile?** 

It's so simple and there are three ways to do it: 

1\. Visit the website, log in and choose **Edit Profile** on the dropdown menu on the right of the header, as you can see in the example below.

<br>

2\. Go to Panel, **Profile Options** -> **Edit Profile**. 

  ![EditProfileUser2](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EditProfileUser2.png) 

<br>

3\. Only the administrator of the website could use this way: Go to Panel, **Users** -> **Edit Profile** 


  ![EditProfileAdmin](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EditProfileAdmin.png)

Don't forget to press **update** when you finish editing your profile!
