# How to configure Image Settings 
<br>
The Images setting page allows you to configure a variety of settings for images uploaded to your Open-Classifieds site. <br>
You can modify these settings when you go to the Panel, **Settings** -> **Images**. 

<br>
![ImagesSettings](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ImagesSettings.png) 

<br>
When a user uploads an image, OC automatically resizes that image, changes its quality and generates a thumbnail. More details about these settings are listed below: 

+ **Allowed image formats:** Set this up to restrict image formats that are being uploaded to your server.
+ **Max image size:** Control the size of images being uploaded. Enter an integer value to set a maximum image size in megabytes (Mb).

Each image is resized when uploaded. 

+ **Image height** (in pixels): This is the height of the big image. Note: You can leave this field blank to set AUTO height resize.
+ **Image width** (in pixels): This is the width of the big image.

A thumb is a small image resized to fit certain elements. 

+ **Thumb height** (in pixels): This is the height of the thumb.
+ **Thumb width** (in pixels): This is the width of the thumb.
+ **Image quality:** Choose the quality of the stored images (1-100% of the original).
+ **Watermark:** Appends watermark to images.
+ **Watermark path:** Relative path to the image to use as watermark.
+ **Watermark position:** You can select where you want the watermark to be placed. 

There are more details about **Watermark**, **Watermark path** and **Watermark position** in _[this]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-add-a-watermark/)_ guide. 

+ **Disallow nude pictures:** Restrict likely nude pictures that are being uploaded to your server.
