I"ù<p>We prepared this guide after seeing many questions regarding the purchase process, so here are the simple steps you need to take to make a purchase and add it to your site:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong><a href="https://selfhosted.yclas.com/">our market</a></strong> and you <strong>choose a product</strong></li>
  <li>Go through the <strong>payment process</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Download</strong> the product</li>
  <li><strong>Check your e-mail</strong> (make sure itâ€™s the <strong>same</strong> one you used when you registered)</li>
</ol>

<p>You should receive <strong>two e-mails</strong> from us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An email thanking you for your purchase.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/first-e-mail.png" alt="first-e-mail" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Another email with the purchase receipt as indicated in the screenshots below. <strong>Please check the spam folder in your e-mail</strong> if you canâ€™t find one of these emails.

</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As you can see in those e-mails, the first one has your <strong>log in information</strong> for your portal here. And the second e-mail has your <strong>license number.</strong></p>

<p>Another way to get your license number is to log in to your panel <strong><a href="https://selfhosted.yclas.com/oc-panel/auth/login">here</a></strong> and go to <strong>Purchases</strong>, there you will find your license number (as indicated in the picture below).</p>

<p><img src="//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/license-in-panel-1024x516.png" alt="license in panel 1024x516" /></p>

<p>Hope that this helps! 
Regards from Kinan and the Yclas team.</p>
