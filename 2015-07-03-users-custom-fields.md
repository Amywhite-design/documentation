# How to create custom fields for users?

Note that custom fields for users are available only for the Premium Users. When you 're ready to have a Premium Theme, go to our [market](http://open-classifieds.com/market/).

This is a new feature included in our 2.4.0 release. Now, Open-Classifieds allows you to ask extra information on user registration and to display it on his profile.

## Examples

For example, you can create a Custom Field and call it "Age". On the user registration form, a new field named "Age" will appear, so user to provide their age when they register. Some other ideas: _birthday_, _province_, _phone number_, _address_ etc.

## Trick

Also, you can create Custom Fields for users for a trick. Create a user Custom Field and name it **paypalaccount**. On the user registration form, users will see this new field to enter their PayPal email address that will be used to get paid from their ads, if a different PayPal email address is not set in the advertisement. For more information follow [this guide](http://docs.yclas.com/paypal-email-for-sellers/).
