<p>Donâ€™t worry, probably it is not that complicated as it may seem!</p>

<p><strong>How to see whatâ€™s the error about?</strong></p>

<p>You need to log in at your <strong>Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong>, then you will see something like:</p>

<p><img src="//open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/System-logs-eshop-test.png" alt="System logs eshop test" /></p>

<p>Here are the error logs that happened in the application and a bit of explanation of whatâ€™s going on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you canâ€™t access to your panel, probably your MySQL server is gone. Contact your hosting provider.</li>
  <li>If you canâ€™t access to your site, contact your hosting provider as well.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>If you canâ€™t access your error log</strong> follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open in your editor <strong>/oc/bootstrap.php</strong> (accessed from file manager or FTP)</li>
  <li>Search for <strong>=== â€˜reoc.loâ€™</strong> and replace it with <strong>!== â€˜reoc.loâ€™</strong></li>
  <li>Now you should see the error with some debug information in the footer</li>
  <li>Revert the changes on the bootstrap.php file</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you still donâ€™t see any error at your logs</strong>, you can check the error log at your hosting.</p>

<p>In your <strong>cPanel</strong> itâ€™s located at <strong>Home</strong> &gt; <strong>Logs</strong> &gt; <strong>Error Log.</strong> If you are the admin of your server, you can type:</p>

<p><code>sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log</code> or something similar to see all the errors</p>
