# How to use import tool for categories and locations?

0You are building a large scale **classifieds website** with lots of categories and locations, but you're having a problem with adding them all in without spending so much time on typing each category or location and pressing enter with our quick category/location creator.

We have the solution for you! You can use an easy import tool to add all of your locations and categories with a press of a button. You simple need to follow those steps:

1. Log into your **Admin Panel** 
2. Go to **Tools** > **Import tool** 
3. Upload CSV files for your locations and categories

<br>
The CSV file should have two fields:

+ **Name:** the name of the category/location (mandatory)
+ **Seoname**: your chosen SEO name for the category/location (this is optional to enter)

Here is a small example of how it should be:
