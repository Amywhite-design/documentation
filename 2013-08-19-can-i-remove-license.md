# Remove licence or banner

Open Classifieds is an **Open Source** script. You are allowed to use our software **completely for free**. The only thing we ask you in return is to give a recognition of our work and to **keep license information in the footer** \- we kindly ask you to not remove the following information:

![licence information](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/licence-inforamtion.png)

[![licence information](http://i0.wp.com/open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/default-homepage.png?fit=512%2C512)](http://open-classifieds.com/2013/08/19/can-i-remove-license/default-homepage/)

The only way to remove this caption is to get a **commercial lifetime license** for using our product. You can do it by buying any of **[premium themes](http://open-classifieds.com/market/)** or ordering **[hosting](http://open-classifieds.com/hosting/)** plan prepared with our affiliate Inmotion. As a premium user you are allowed to delete license information. [See download options here](http://open-classifieds.com/download/).

Premium themes are also free of publicity - if you donâ€™t want extra banners to appear at your site, please consider buying one of them!
