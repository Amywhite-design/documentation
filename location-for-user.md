Location for user is a feature that allows you to show the location of the user on a map in the profile page. This way sellers can show their location and attract more local customers.

## Prerequisites

1. On **Settings -> Advertisement -> Display Option**, enable **Google Maps in Ad and Profile page**
2. User needs to edit his profile, fill the address field and press **Update**

![User location](//docs.yclas.com/images/user-location-1.png)
</a>

## How it works

User enters his address into his profile and a static map is automatically displayed as an image in the user profile page. Below the map there's an option to show the location of the user in a map view.
