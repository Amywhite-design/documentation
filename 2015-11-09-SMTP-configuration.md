# How to configure SMTP

If you prefer to have your mail sent out via a different SMTP server than your hosting, you can use this option. What you have to do is to go to your panel, **Settings** -> **Email** and specify or enable:

+ **Smtp active**: Enable this to activate SMTP
+ **Smtp ssl**: Enable if the SMTP connection needs to occur over ssl
+ **Smtp host**
+ **Smtp port**
+ **Smtp auth**: If SMTPAuth should be used
+ **Smtp user**
+ **Smtp password**

When you finish with the configuration, click **SAVE**
