**Locations** makes it possible to segregate ads by place or city. Thanks to this users can narrow their search ads within their geographical territory.

This is probably the easiest and fastest way to add multiple locations. What you have to do is to choose a location (Continent, Country, State/Province, County/Region or City) and press **Import** to import its sub-locations. <br>
For example, if you choose:<br>
Continent = Europe<br>
Country = Spain<br>
State/Province = Catalonia<br>
and then click Import, it will add Barcelona, Girona, Lleidia and Tarragona to your locations. 

Then, you can add the sub-locations of a location. <br>
If you have added Barcelona in your locations, click **Browse** on the right of this location. <br>
Then choose:<br>
Continent = Europe<br>
Country = Spain<br>
State/Province = Catalonia<br>
County/Region = Barcelona<br>
and click "Import" to add all the sub-locations of Barcelona.

## How to manage locations

Managing them is very easy. If you want to move locations and change their order you just need to drag and drop selected one to the chosen place.

To change something, e.g. name or description of the location, you can click the **Edit** button.

To **delete** press the button with trash bin. Note that when you delete parent locations inside of it, it will be moved to level up - to the parent of the deleted location.
