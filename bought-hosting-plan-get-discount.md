We referred to this in many areas at our site, that if you **[purchase a web hosting](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html)** from our [referral link](https://inmotion-hosting.evyy.net/c/458796/260033/4222?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inmotionhosting.com%2Fbusiness-hosting), you are entitled to:

* a discount of $185.
* 3 months of support from Yclas team,
* a decent 50% discount from Inmotion.

So it is a very good deal! 

**Once you do the purchase, [contact us](https://yclas.com/contact/) with the following information:**

- The **e-mail** you are going to use for purchase 
- Your **domain** 
- Your **Inmotion hosting ID**, which you can find in your receipt (looks like this IMH -XXX - XXXXXX) 

You can send the above information through the following contact page:
