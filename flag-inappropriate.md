Since our 2.6.0 release users can report an ad as inappropriate.

Below each ad, users will find this button:

![flag-inappropriate](//docs.yclas.com/images/flag-inappropriate.png)


By clicking this button they will be redirected to the contact page, where Subject and Message are already filled with the necessary text.

![flag-inappropriate2](//docs.yclas.com/images/flag-inappropriate2.png)


Email will be sent to the administrator of the website in order to review the reported ad.
