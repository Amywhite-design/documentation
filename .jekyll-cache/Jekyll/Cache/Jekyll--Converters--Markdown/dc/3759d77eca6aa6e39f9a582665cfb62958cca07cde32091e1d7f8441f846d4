<p>“I was playing around with the user roles and accidentally changed the admin role to “1” instead of “10” on my admin account. Now I can’t do anything as I don’t have any admin permissions at all.”</p>

<p><strong>If that happened to you, here is how to fix it:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Login to your <strong>cPanel</strong> at your hosting</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>phpMyAdmin</strong></li>
  <li>Select your <strong>Yclas database</strong></li>
  <li>Go to table <strong>oc3_users</strong></li>
  <li>Search for your user and change the <strong>id_role</strong> to “<strong>10</strong>”.</li>
</ol>

<p>What is more, if you forgot your password and somehow the “ <strong>Forgot my password</strong> “ function isn’t working, you can fix that by registering a new user and following the above mentioned steps to make the <strong>new user admin</strong>.</p>

<p>Let us know what guide you want next and we will write it for you and include it to our FAQ section. You just need to post a comment in the section below.</p>

<p>Regards from Yclas team.</p>
