<strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></i> </strong> This guide is only for Yclas Self Hosted!
</div>

<p>Yclas Self Hosted allows you to have more than 1 language active at the same time.</p>

<p>This means that you can <strong>easily change the site translation</strong> to any language you have in the site. Then simply add links in your sidebar or header using our widgets or the menu generator to link languages.</p>

<h2 id="languages-widget">Languages Widget</h2>

<p>The languages widget let users choose in which language your website will be translated to them. To create this widget, go to your panel, <strong>Appearance</strong> -&gt; <strong>Widgets</strong> and click to create the Languages Widget.</p>

<p>After that, a list with your selected languages will appear in your website so users can choose their prefered language. For more information about it, check out <a href="//docs.yclas.com/languages-widget/">this guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="different-languages---the-same-installation">Different languages - the same installation</h2>

<p>This is an an example of our demo in different languages: <a href="http://demo.yclas.com/?language=en_EN">English</a>,Â <a href="http://demo.yclas.com/?language=bn_BD">Bengali</a>,Â <a href="http://demo.yclas.com/?language=ca_ES">Catalan</a>.Â This has some benefits and some negative things too.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to activate</li>
  <li>Share the same users and ads database</li>
  <li>The same domain</li>
  <li>The same theme license</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ads donâ€™t have language attribute, this means you can not filter by language</li>
  <li>Categories and locations are not by language either, so once you write a category name it would be the same for all languages.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I donâ€™t like this option at all</strong>. As a better alternatives and also better for SEO, we recommend the <strong>3 other options</strong>. How to configure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go toÂ http://yourdomain.com/oc-panel/config/update/allow_query_language</li>
  <li>Set Config Value to 1</li>
  <li>Save</li>
  <li>Now to link to a language simply :Â http://domain.com/?language=ca_ES</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="domain-per-language">Domain per language</h2>

<p>This is probably the best option, imagine you have: MyDomain.com, and you want to add Spanish and Italian translations, you will buy the domains MyDomain.es and MyDomain.it and you will have the separate sites per language. Itâ€™s more expensive, but it allows you to use a local name in the domain name and for google to crawl it better.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better SEOÂ per domain language, THIS IS A HUGE difference</li>
  <li>Can use the same design</li>
  <li>User is not confused and not lost between languages</li>
  <li>If you want, you can add a localized server for the domain extension, so the domain is in the language of the country.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You need a license for each domain for your premium theme</li>
  <li>You need different domain names (which costs)</li>
  <li>Separate administration of the site, software updates and moderation</li>
  <li>Maybe more expenses on hosting</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="sub-domain-per-language">Sub-Domain per language</h2>

<p>If you donâ€™t want to have many domains and want to save some money then this would be a better option. Â Imagine you have: MyDomain.com, and you also want to add Spanish and Italian translations, you will create sub domains like es.MyDomain.com and it.MyDomain.com and you will have separate sites per language.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Itâ€™s better SEOÂ per domain language</li>
  <li>You can use the same design</li>
  <li>The user will not be confused and not lost between languages two different languages</li>
  <li>Same domain / hosting</li>
  <li>If you want, you can add a localized server for the sub-domain, so the sub-domain is in the language of the country</li>
  <li>1 license works on as many subdomains as you want!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Separate administration of the site, software updates and moderation</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="folder-per-language">Folder per language</h2>

<p>If you donâ€™t want to have many domains/sub domain and save some money maybe this is the option for you. I donâ€™t prefer this option, but it will work better than the first one.Â Example: you have MyDomain.com, and you also want to add an Spanish and an Italian translations, you will create folders like MyDomain.com/es and MyDomain.com/it and you will have different OC installations per language.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use the same design, theme and license</li>
  <li>The same domain / hosting</li>
  <li>The same license</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Separate administration of the site, software updates and moderation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to configure:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You simply do a <a href="http://docs.yclas.com/install-self-hosted/">new installation</a> at a new folder within your website, follow the screenshot below to see how to do it using Softaculous.</li>
</ul>
