For the past period we've been working on helping **developers** and **advanced users** to understand more how the information is distributed in Yclas database and to give a better overall understanding of how Yclas works.

Basically, this is a detailed description of the database tables created during the installation of Yclas. Currently, the database supported by Yclas is MySQL version 5.0 or greater.

You can check [the full database description](https://github.com/open-classifieds/openclassifieds2/wiki/Database-Description).
