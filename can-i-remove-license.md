<strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></i> </strong> This guide is only for Yclas Self Hosted!
</div>

Yclas Self Hosted is an **Open Source** script. You are allowed to use our software **completely for free**. The only thing we ask you in return is to give a recognition of our work and to **keep license information in the footer** \- we kindly ask you to not remove the following information:

<a href="//docs.yclas.com/images/licenseYclasSH2.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![licence information]({{site.baseurl}}/images/licenseYclasSH2.png)
</a>

<a href="//docs.yclas.com/images/licenseYclasSH.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![licence information]({{site.baseurl}}/images/licenseYclasSH.png)
</a>

The only way to remove this caption is to get a **commercial lifetime license** for using our product. You can do it by buying any of **[premium themes](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes)** or **[Yclas Self-Hosted PRO](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes/yclas-self-hosted-pro.html)**. As a premium user you are allowed to delete license information. [See the download options here](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html#package).

Premium themes are also free of publicity - if you donâ€™t want extra banners to appear at your site, please consider buying one of them!
