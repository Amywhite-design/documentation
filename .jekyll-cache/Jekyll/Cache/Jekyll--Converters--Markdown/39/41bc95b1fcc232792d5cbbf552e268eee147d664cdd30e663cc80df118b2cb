<p>Some times you either forget or misstype your password. Almost all of the web services that require a login have a specified number of consecutive invalid login attempts allowed. After that number of attempts, you are restricted from further login attempts for a certain time period.</p>

<p>If your website is made with the Yclas Self Hosted script, then it works as below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After 3 Failed Login attempts: <em>Login has been temporarily disabled due to too many unsuccessful login attempts. Please try again in a minute.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 5 Failed Login attempts: <em>Login has been temporarily disabled due to too many unsuccessful login attempts. Please try again in 24 hours.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have access to phpmyadmin, there is nothing to worry about! <strong>Follow these steps to set login attempts to 0:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to phpmyadmin from the cPanel of your hosting.</li>
  <li>On the database of your website, choose the table named ‘oc3_users’.</li>
  <li>Find the user you want and change the value of the field ‘failed_attempts’ to ‘0’ (zero).</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you are allowed to login to your website!</p>
