  * **To**: choose from one of the following options who should receive the message.
  * **From:** write your name that will be displayed as sender.
  * **From Email:** type email that will be displayed for recipients - all replies will be directed to this address.
  * **Subject:** topic of the message.
  * **Message:** body of the email, you can use formatting.

</a>

If you need to configure advanced settings, choose **Email Settings** to configure your email options.

When you hit **Send, **your message will be sent to the number of recipients that is shown in the grey field at the top of the newsletter box.

![Newsletter 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/newsletter1.png)
</a>

All registered users will get your message as a **blind copy** \- details of other users won't be shown.

Please, note that the emails will be sent from server which may cause problems when sending newsletters to a large number of recipients. If you need to send many emails with a high delivery rate, check a professional tool like **[ElasticEmail](http://j.mp/elasticemailoc)**.
